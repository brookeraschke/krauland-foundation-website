		<p>John Krauland, Jr. was such a compassionate and loving man.  He was tragically taken from all of us at 28 years old on March 14, 2014.  John was taken 
		far too soon; he still had so many things to offer the world.  He always had a smile on his face that could light up the room.  He could look past difficult 
		times and find positives in any situation.  He always wanted to make sure his family and friends were enjoying life and simply "having fun."</p>

		<p>John was involved in football since he was a little boy.  He was a three-year varsity letter winner at Knoch High School where he led his team into playoffs 
		his senior year.  He earned a scholarship to Slippery Rock University and a starting position as an offensive lineman.  Once he graduated, John still 
		found himself on a football field through a flag football league.  He was also involved in a Sunday softball league with many of his close friends from 
		high school.   In his spare time, you could find him spending time with his wife and dog, on the golf course, basketball court, or outside.</p>
		
		<p>John was also very passionate about his faith.  He took his grandmother to church every Sunday.  He became more involved in his church by volunteering as a 
		7th grade CCD teacher, a Eucharistic minister, and a lector.  His degree at Slippery Rock University in Safety and Environmental Management led him to his 
		career at The Catholic Diocese as a Loss Control and Safety Coordinator.</p>
		
		<p>The John Krauland, Jr. Memorial Foundation will continue to remember such wonderful attributes of John, and it will allow his name to continue by helping 
		students who are in similar administrations as John.  This foundation will provide scholarships to Knoch or Deer Lakes High School Seniors who are attending a four-year 
		college or university.  A student must show outstanding achievement in school, participation in a high school sport, and involvement in his or her church 
		to be eligible for this scholarship.</p>
		
		<p>John was always willing to help anyone he possibly could.  It didn't make a difference whether you were family, a friend, or a complete stranger; John
		was there for you either with his words or wisdom or to lending a helping hand.  So in addition to the scholarship, the foundation will be providing a Community
		Assistance Program.  This program will allow members of the community to nominate a person or family who is in need of some help.  Each month, the foundation
		will select a person or family to which they will provide assistance.</p>
