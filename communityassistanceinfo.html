	<h1>Community Assistance Information</h1>
	<p>The John Krauland, Jr. Foundation is proud to announce a Community Assistance Program.  John was always willing to help out family, friends, and
	even strangers.  He would drop everything he was doing to help someone who needed it.  He always went over to his grandparents' house to assist them.
	He would also help family and friends in various ways such as: cutting down trees, putting down hardwood floors, and moving.  A perfect example of how
	much John cared about people was when a seventeen-year-old boy rear ended him.  John learned he was on his way to a tennis match.  John offered to drive
	him to the match, as his car was no longer drivable.  The following day John called him to ask, "Did you win?!"  No matter what anyone needed, John
	had the biggest heart and was always there with open arms.</p>
  <p>As a result, the foundation would like to continue to help families, friends, and community members by creating a Community Assistance Program.  Maybe
	a family member's furnace broke in the middle of winter and they can't afford one right away.  Maybe an elderly neighbor can't cut his or her grass.
	Please let the foundation know how we can help.  If you know of anyone that may be having a difficult time and is in need of some assistance, please
	fill out the following form and send an email to <a href = "mailto:jkmemorialfoundation@gmail.com">jkmemorialfoundation@gmail.com</a> with the
	subject heading "Community Assistance." and the form below.</p>
	
	<div class=box>
		<b>We would like to help one person or family per month!</b>

		<p>The Foundation will not publish any personal information, or post any likenesses, of those who volunteer or identify someone in need without their
		prior consent, but may post details about projects undertaken and work done around the community.</p>
		<p>We hope to keep John's spirit alive and continue to help make life a little easier and happier!</p>
